# Net Current Asset Value Effect (NCAVE)

Net current asset value (NCAV/MV) is the famous strategy popularized (and used) by the father of security analysis, Benjamin Graham. NCAV is the balance sheet current assets minus all the firmâ€™s (current and long-term) liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. Long-term assets (e.g., intangible assets and fixed assets) values are not counted.

A lot of these stocks are so cheap because the companies are in distress and will eventually go bankrupt. But the rest of the stocks bought with an extreme discount statistically gain more, and the overall portfolio return is highly positive.

NCAVE considers the top 3000 most liquid stocks traded on NYSE and NASDAQ and invests in stocks that have an NCAV metric greater than `threshold`. Investments are made on the first trading day of July and held for a minimum of one year.
