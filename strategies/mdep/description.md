# Momentum Driven Earnings Prediction

Momentum Driven Earnings Prediction selects stocks to invest in that have a strong potential
to beat earnings estimates. It can rebalance on a weekly or monthly basis and only invests
if the crash protection signal is greater than or equal to zero. If the crash protection signal is less than zero then the out-of-market ticker is invested in.
